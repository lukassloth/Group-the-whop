        <!-- Beskrivende paragraf -->
        <p>Welcome to our website, where we explore the fascinating relationship between renewable energy, 
            land usage, and energy consumption around the world. This platform is designed to help you compare 
            the land mass of different countries with their average sunshine hours and energy consumption. 
            Using this data, we calculate how much of each country's land mass would need to be covered with solar 
            panels or nuclear power plants to meet their energy needs.</p>
        
        <h3>What You'll Learn:</h3> <!-- Underoverskrift -->
        <ul> <!-- Prikket listeform -->
            <!-- 2 list items -->
            <li><strong>Solar Energy Potential:</strong> Discover how the average sunshine hours in a country impact the efficiency of solar panels. 
                We provide insights into how much land mass would be required to generate sufficient solar power for each nation's energy needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Nuclear Energy Analysis:</strong> Explore the compact and high-energy output potential of nuclear power plants and how they 
                compare to solar energy in terms of land mass usage and energy production.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Why Solar Energy?</h3> <!-- Underoverskrift -->
        <ul> <!-- Prikket listeform -->
            <!-- 3 list items -->
            <li>Solar panels provide a <strong>clean and renewable energy source</strong>, producing electricity without greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            <li>They leverage the natural resource of sunlight, making them particularly effective in countries with high levels of sunshine.</li>
            <li>Solar installations can be <strong>integrated into existing structures</strong> (e.g., rooftops), reducing their environmental footprint.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Why Nuclear Power?</h3> <!-- Underoverskrift -->
        <ul> <!-- Prikket listeform -->
            <!-- 3 list items -->
            <li>Nuclear power plants deliver a <strong>consistent and reliable energy supply</strong>, unaffected by weather conditions or time of day.</li>
            <li>They require a <strong>smaller land mass area</strong> compared to solar farms, for a much larger energy output.</li>
            <li>Nuclear energy has a <strong>low carbon footprint</strong>, making it a critical part of the transition to sustainable energy systems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- Beskrivende paragraf -->
        <p>By combining interactive data visualizations with informative comparisons, our website aims to educate and engage users in
